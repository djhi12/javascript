        /*
            In JavaScript, the onload() event is used to trigger a particular function or set of instructions when a web page or a specific element within the page has finished loading.

            For example, you might use onload() to ensure that a certain script or image has fully loaded before allowing the user to interact with the page.

            The onload() event can be attached to various elements on a web page, including the window object, which represents the overall page, as well as individual HTML tags like img, audio, and video.

            Here's an example of how you might use onload() to ensure that an image is fully loaded before allowing the user to interact with it:
        */

        // In this example, the onload() event is triggered when the img tag has finished loading the specified image. The function enableInteraction() will then be called, which might do things like enable a button or activate a hover effect.
