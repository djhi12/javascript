        /*
            JavaScript Template Literals are a feature introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) that allow for easier string formatting and manipulation in JavaScript.

            They are delimited by backticks ( ) instead of single or double quotes and allow for the inclusion of placeholders that are denoted by the ${} syntax. The placeholders can contain any valid JavaScript expression, including variables, function calls, and even other template literals.
        */

        // Here's an example of how to use template literals:
        const name = "John";
        const age = 30;

        const message = `My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;

        console.log(message); // Output: "My name is John and I am 30 years old."

        // In the above example, the template literal is used to create a message that includes the values of the name and age variables. The placeholders are denoted by the ${} syntax, and the expressions inside the placeholders are evaluated and then inserted into the resulting string.


        // Template literals also support multi-line strings, which can be useful for formatting longer messages. Here's an example:
        const message2 = `This is a multi-line string that spans multiple lines. It can include variables like ${name} and ${age}.`;

        console.log(message2); // Output: 
        /*
        This is a multi-line string
        that spans multiple lines.
        It can include variables like John and 30.
        */


        /*
            Template literals offer a more concise and readable way to create strings with dynamic content, and can be a useful tool in JavaScript development.
        */



        // Example Program
        // Define some variables
        const name1 = 'John';
        const age1 = 30;
        const city = 'New York';

        // Using template literals to create a string with dynamic values
        const message1 = `Hello, my name is ${name1}, I am ${age1} years old, and I live in ${city1}.`;

        // Output the message to the console
        console.log(message1);
