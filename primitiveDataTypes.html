        /*
            In JavaScript, there are six primitive data types:

                Undefined: This data type has only one value, undefined. It is used when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value.

                Null: This data type has only one value, null. It is used to indicate the absence of any object value.

                Boolean: This data type has two values, true and false. It is used to represent logical values.

                Number: This data type is used to represent numeric values. It includes integers, floating-point numbers, and NaN (Not a Number).

                String: This data type is used to represent textual data. It is a sequence of Unicode characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

                Symbol: This data type was introduced in ECMAScript 6. It is used to create unique identifiers for object properties. Symbols are created using the Symbol() function.

            Primitive data types are immutable, which means that their values cannot be changed once they are created.
