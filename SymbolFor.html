            In JavaScript, the Symbol.for() method is used to create and retrieve a shared symbol from the global symbol registry. This method creates a symbol if it does not already exist in the registry with the specified key, or returns the existing symbol associated with that key.
        */


        // The syntax for Symbol.for() is as follows:
        Symbol.for(key)

        // Here, key is a string that is used as the key to look up or create a shared symbol in the global symbol registry. If a symbol with the same key already exists in the registry, the existing symbol is returned. Otherwise, a new symbol is created and added to the registry with the specified key.


        // Here is an example of using Symbol.for() to create a shared symbol and retrieve it later:
        // Create a shared symbol with the key 'mySymbol'
        const mySymbol = Symbol.for('mySymbol');

        // Retrieve the shared symbol using the same key
        const mySymbol2 = Symbol.for('mySymbol');

        // These symbols are the same because they were created with the same key
        console.log(mySymbol === mySymbol2); // true

        /*
            In this example, the Symbol.for() method is used to create a shared symbol with the key 'mySymbol'. When the method is called again with the same key 'mySymbol', it returns the same symbol that was previously created. The === operator is used to check that the two symbols are the same, which outputs true.

            Note that unlike Symbol(), which creates a new unique symbol each time it is called, Symbol.for() creates and retrieves a shared symbol with the same key. This makes it useful for creating symbols that can be shared and used across different parts of an application.
