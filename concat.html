        /*
            The concat() method is a built-in function in JavaScript that is used to combine two or more arrays into a new array. The original arrays are not modified, and a new array is returned containing the elements of the original arrays.

            Here is the syntax for using the concat() method:
            newArray = array1.concat(array2, array3, ..., arrayN)
        */

        /*
            where array1 is the original array that you want to concatenate with array2, array3, and so on, up to arrayN.

            For example, let's say we have two arrays, array1 and array2, and we want to concatenate them into a new array called newArray. Here is how we would use the concat() method:
        */
        var array1 = [1, 2, 3];
        var array2 = [4, 5, 6];

        var newArray = array1.concat(array2);

        console.log(newArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

        /*
            In this example, newArray will contain all the elements of array1 followed by all the elements of array2.

            Note that the concat() method can also be used to concatenate other types of elements, such as strings or numbers, as well as arrays. When you pass a non-array argument to the concat() method, it is treated as a single-element array, and its value is added to the new array.

        // Sample Program
        var array1 = [1, 2, 3];
        var array2 = [4, 5, 6];
        var array3 = ["a", "b", "c"];

        // Concatenate two arrays
        var newArray1 = array1.concat(array2);
        console.log(newArray1); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

        // Concatenate three arrays
        var newArray2 = array1.concat(array2, array3);
        console.log(newArray2); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, "a", "b", "c"]

        // Concatenate array with a string
        var newArray3 = array1.concat("hello");
        console.log(newArray3); // Output: [

        // In the first example, we concatenate array1 and array2 to create a new array called newArray1. In the second example, we concatenate array1, array2, and array3 to create a new array called newArray2. In the third example, we concatenate array1 with the string "hello" to create a new array called newArray3.
