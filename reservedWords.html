            In JavaScript, there are certain words that have a special meaning and are reserved for use by the language itself. These words are known as "reserved words" or "keywords".

            Some examples of reserved words in JavaScript include:

                var
                let
                const
                if
                else
                for
                while
                function
                return
                class
                typeof
                null
                undefined
            
                These words cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifier within a JavaScript program. Attempting to use a reserved word as an identifier will result in a syntax error.

            It is important to be aware of reserved words when writing JavaScript code to avoid unintentional errors or conflicts with the language itself.

            Here are some additional reserved words in JavaScript:

                break
                case
                catch
                continue
                debugger
                default
                delete
                do
                export
                extends
                finally
                from
                get
                if
                import
                in
                instanceof
                new
                of
                package
                private
                protected
                public
                set
                static
                super
                switch
                this
                throw
                try
                typeof
                void
                while
                with
                yield
            
                These words are all reserved for specific purposes in JavaScript, and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifier within a JavaScript program.
