        /*
            A while loop is a type of loop in JavaScript that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition remains true. Here is the basic syntax of a while loop in JavaScript:
        */

        while (condition) {
            // code to be executed
        }

        /*
            The condition is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, then the code inside the loop is executed. Once the code inside the loop has finished executing, the condition is evaluated again. This process continues until the condition becomes false.
        */

        // Here is an example of a while loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10:
        let i = 1;
        while (i <= 10) {
            console.log(i);
            i++;
        }

        // In this example, the condition is i <= 10. As long as i is less than or equal to 10, the loop will continue to execute. Inside the loop, the value of i is printed to the console using console.log(i), and then i is incremented by 1 using i++. This process continues until i becomes greater than 10, at which point the loop terminates.
