        /*
            In JavaScript, the term "scope" refers to the region of the code where a particular variable or function can be accessed. There are two main types of scope in JavaScript: global scope and local scope.

            Global scope refers to variables or functions that are declared outside of any function or block. These variables or functions can be accessed from anywhere within the code, including within functions or blocks.

            Local scope, on the other hand, refers to variables or functions that are declared within a function or block. These variables or functions can only be accessed within the function or block in which they are declared.

            JavaScript also has the concept of "lexical scope," which means that the scope of a variable or function is determined by where it is defined in the code, rather than where it is called or used. This means that a variable declared in a higher-level scope (such as the global scope or a function scope) can be accessed from a lower-level scope, but a variable declared in a lower-level scope cannot be accessed from a higher-level scope.

            In addition to these basic types of scope, JavaScript also has the concept of "closure," which allows a function to access variables from its surrounding lexical scope, even after that scope has been exited. Closures can be a powerful tool for creating functions that encapsulate data and behavior in a self-contained way.
