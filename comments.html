            JavaScript comments are annotations within the code that are not executed by the program but are included to provide additional information or context to the reader. Comments in JavaScript are used to make the code more readable, understandable, and maintainable.

        // Single-line comments: Single-line comments start with // and are used to add comments on a single line.
        // This is a single line comment.


        // Multi-line comments: Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */. These comments can span over multiple lines.
        /*

        /*
            Comments are ignored by the JavaScript interpreter and are not executed. They are used to explain the code, provide additional information, or disable code temporarily for debugging purposes.

            Comments are useful for documenting the code, making it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the code. They can also be used to remind oneself of the code's purpose or to temporarily disable a piece of code during debugging.
