            /*
             In JavaScript, the break statement is used to exit or terminate a loop prematurely. It is primarily used within for loops, while loops, and switch statements.

            Here's how break works in different contexts:
             */

            // Inside a for loop:
            for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                if (i === 3) {
                    break; // This will exit the loop when i equals 3.
                }
                console.log(i);
            }
            // Output: 0, 1, 2

            /*
            In this example, the break statement is used to exit the for loop when i becomes equal to 3. As a result, the loop terminates, and the remaining iterations are skipped.
            */


            // Inside a while loop:
            var i = 0;
            while (i < 5) {
                if (i === 3) {
                    break; // This will exit the loop when i equals 3.
                }
                console.log(i);
                i++;
            }
            // Output: 0, 1, 2

            /*
            Similar to the for loop, the break statement can also be used to exit a while loop prematurely.
            */


            // Inside a switch statement:
            var day = "Monday";
            switch (day) {
                case "Monday":
                    console.log("It's Monday!");
                    break; // This will exit the switch statement.
                case "Tuesday":
                    console.log("It's Tuesday!");
                    break;
                default:
                    console.log("It's another day.");
            }
            // Output: It's Monday!

            /*
            In this case, the break statement is used to exit the switch statement after the code block associated with the "Monday" case is executed. Without the break statement, the execution would continue to the "Tuesday" case.

            The break statement is a powerful tool for controlling the flow of your code within loops and switch statements, allowing you to exit them when certain conditions are met.
