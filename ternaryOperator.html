        /*
            In JavaScript, the ternary operator is a concise way to write conditional statements. It is a shorthand version of an if-else statement. The syntax of the ternary operator is as follows:

            (condition) ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
        */


        /*
            The ternary operator takes three operands: a condition, an expression to evaluate if the condition is true, and an expression to evaluate if the condition is false.

            For example, suppose we want to assign a value to a variable based on whether a condition is true or false. We could use an if-else statement to accomplish this:
        */
        let result;
        if (condition) {
            result = 'Value if condition is true';
        } else {
            result = 'Value if condition is false';
        }

        // Alternatively, we could use the ternary operator to achieve the same result in a more concise way:
        let result2 = (condition) ? 'Value if condition is true' : 'Value if condition is false';

        /*
            In the above example, if the condition is true, the value 'Value if condition is true' is assigned to the result variable. Otherwise, the value 'Value if condition is false' is assigned to the result variable.

            It's important to note that the ternary operator should be used sparingly and only in cases where the expression being evaluated is short and simple. Overusing the ternary operator can make code harder to read and understand.
        */


        // Example Code
        let age = 20;
        let canVote = (age >= 18) ? "Yes" : "No";

        console.log(`Can the person vote? ${canVote}`);

        // In this code, we define a variable age with a value of 20. We then use the ternary operator to assign the value "Yes" to the canVote variable if age is greater than or equal to 18, and "No" if it's not. Finally, we log the result to the console using string interpolation.

        // The output of the above code will be: Can the person vote? Yes

        // Since the value of age is 20 and therefore greater than or equal to 18, the canVote variable is assigned the value "Yes".
