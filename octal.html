            In JavaScript, octal refers to a base-8 numbering system that uses the digits 0 through 7 to represent values.
        */


        // To write an octal number in JavaScript, you can prefix it with a leading zero (0) followed by the octal digits. For example:
        const octalNumber = 0o71; // equals 57 in decimal


        // You can also use the parseInt() function with a radix of 8 to convert an octal string to a decimal number. For example:
        const octalString = '72';
        const decimalNumber = parseInt(octalString, 8); // equals 58 in decimal

        // It's worth noting that octal literals are not allowed in strict mode, which is a mode in JavaScript that enforces stricter rules for code syntax and behavior. In strict mode, attempting to use an octal literal will result in a syntax error.
