            /*
            In JavaScript, the default statement is often used in the context of a switch statement. The switch statement is a control flow statement that allows you to execute different code blocks based on the value of an expression. The default statement is used as a fallback option when none of the case values match the expression being evaluated.

            Here's the basic syntax of a switch statement with a default statement:
            */

            switch (expression) {
                case value1:
                    // Code to be executed if expression === value1
                    break;
                case value2:
                    // Code to be executed if expression === value2
                    break;
                // Additional cases can be added here...
                default:
                // Code to be executed if none of the cases match expression
            }

            /*
            Here's how it works:

            The switch statement evaluates the expression once and then compares the result to each case value.

            If a case value matches the expression, the code block associated with that case is executed, and the break statement is used to exit the switch statement.

            If none of the case values match the expression, the code block associated with the default statement is executed.

            The default statement is optional, and you can include it to handle cases where none of the case values match the expression. It acts like a catch-all or a default action to be taken when no specific condition is met.

            Here's an example:
            */

            let day = 3;
            let dayName;

            switch (day) {
                case 1:
                    dayName = "Monday";
                    break;
                case 2:
                    dayName = "Tuesday";
                    break;
                case 3:
                    dayName = "Wednesday";
                    break;
                default:
                    dayName = "Unknown";
            }

            console.log(`Today is ${dayName}`);

            // In this example, since day is 3, it matches the case 3 block, and dayName will be set to "Wednesday." If day had been any other value, the default block would have been executed, setting dayName to "Unknown."
        </script>
