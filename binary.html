        /*
            In JavaScript, "binary" typically refers to the binary numeral system, which is a number system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. In programming, binary is often used to represent data in a compact and efficient manner.

            JavaScript provides several ways to work with binary data. One common way is to use bitwise operators such as AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), and NOT (~) to manipulate binary data. These operators perform bitwise operations on the individual bits of a binary number.

        // For example, consider the following code:
        var a = 5; // decimal representation
        var b = a.toString(2); // binary representation
        console.log(b); // outputs "101"

        // In this code, the toString() method is used to convert the decimal value 5 to its binary representation. The resulting binary value is then stored in the variable b and printed to the console.


        // JavaScript also provides a parseInt() function that can be used to convert a binary string to a decimal number. For example:
        var b = "101"; // binary string
        var a = parseInt(b, 2); // convert binary string to decimal
        console.log(a); // outputs "5"

        /*
            In this code, the parseInt() function is used to convert the binary string "101" to its decimal representation. The resulting decimal value is then stored in the variable a and printed to the console.

            Overall, working with binary data in JavaScript can be a powerful technique for optimizing performance and reducing memory usage in certain types of applications.
