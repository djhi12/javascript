        /*
            In JavaScript, if, else if, and else statements are used for conditional logic. These statements are used to execute certain code blocks based on certain conditions being met. Here's a brief explanation of each statement:
        */

        // if statement: The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. For example:
        if (x > 10) {
            console.log("x is greater than 10");
        }


        // else if statement: The else if statement is used to specify a new condition to test, if the previous if statement is false. For example:
        if (x > 10) {
            console.log("x is greater than 10");
        } else if (x === 10) {
            console.log("x is equal to 10");
        }


        // else statement: The else statement is used to execute a block of code if none of the specified conditions are true. This statement doesn't take a condition, it simply runs if none of the previous conditions were true. For example:
        if (x > 10) {
            console.log("x is greater than 10");
        } else if (x === 10) {
            console.log("x is equal to 10");
        } else {
            console.log("x is less than 10");
        }

        // In the example above, if x is less than or equal to 10, the else block will be executed.
