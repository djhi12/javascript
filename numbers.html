            In JavaScript, "numbers" refer to a primitive data type that represents numeric values. Numbers can be positive, negative, or zero, and can have decimal places or not. JavaScript also supports scientific notation for representing very large or very small numbers.
        */


        // To create a number in JavaScript, you can simply assign a value to a variable using the number literal syntax. For example:
        let myNumber = 42; // an integer
        let myDecimal = 3.14; // a decimal number
        let myScientific = 1e6; // scientific notation, equivalent to 1000000

        // JavaScript also provides a range of built-in methods and properties for working with numbers, such as Math.round(), Math.floor(), and Math.random().


        // It's important to note that JavaScript has some quirks when it comes to working with numbers, particularly with floating-point arithmetic. For example:
        0.1 + 0.2 // returns 0.30000000000000004

        // To avoid unexpected behavior, it's often recommended to use libraries such as decimal.js or big.js when working with precise numerical calculations in JavaScript.
