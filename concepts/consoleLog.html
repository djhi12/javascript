            console.log() is a method in JavaScript that allows you to log messages to the console, which is typically used for debugging purposes. It can also be used to display information to the user.

        // Here's an example:
        console.log("Hello, world!");

        // When this code is executed, "Hello, world!" will be printed to the console.

        
        // console.log() can also take multiple arguments, like this:
        console.log("The answer is", 42);

        // This will print "The answer is 42" to the console.


        /*
            In addition to console.log(), there are other methods you can use to log messages to the console, such as console.warn() and console.error(). These methods are used to log warning messages and error messages, respectively.
