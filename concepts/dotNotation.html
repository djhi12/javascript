        /*
            In JavaScript, dot notation is a way to access properties and methods of an object. It is a simple and concise syntax that involves using a dot (.) followed by the name of the property or method. Here's an example:
        */

        const person = {
            name: 'John',
            age: 30,
            greet: function () {
                console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
            }
        };

        console.log(person.name); // Output: John
        person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I'm 30 years old.

        // In the example above, we have an object person with three properties: name, age, and greet. We can access the value of the name property using dot notation with person.name. We can also call the greet method using dot notation with person.greet().


        /*
            Using dot notation is not limited to just accessing properties and methods of an object, but also for adding and modifying them. Here's an example of adding a new property to an object using dot notation:
        */

        person.job = 'Developer';
        console.log(person.job); // Output: Developer

        // In the example above, we add a new property job to the person object using dot notation with person.job = 'Developer'. We can then access the value of the job property using dot notation with person.job.


        /*
            Dot notation is a common and easy-to-use syntax in JavaScript and is widely used in many libraries and frameworks.
        */
