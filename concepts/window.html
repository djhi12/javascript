        /*
            In JavaScript, the "window" object represents the browser window that contains the document being displayed. It is a global object and is available to all scripts running in a browser environment.

            The "window" object provides access to various properties and methods that allow you to interact with the browser window, such as:

                Document Object Model (DOM) properties and methods, which allow you to manipulate the contents of the document displayed in the window.

                Location properties and methods, which allow you to get or set the current URL of the window.

                History properties and methods, which allow you to navigate through the user's browsing history.

                Screen properties, which allow you to get information about the user's screen size and resolution.

                Timers, which allow you to schedule code to run at specified intervals or after a certain amount of time has passed.
        */

        
        // Here is an example of how you can access the "window" object and its properties:
        // get the current URL of the window
        var currentUrl = window.location.href;

        // open a new window
        var newWindow = window.open("https://www.example.com", "example", "width=500,height=500");

        // create a timer that runs a function every 5 seconds
        var intervalId = window.setInterval(function () {
            console.log("Hello, world!");
        }, 5000);

        // Note that in most cases, you can omit the "window" prefix when accessing its properties and methods, as they are automatically available in the global scope.
