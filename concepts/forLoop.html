        /*
        A for loop in JavaScript is used for iterating over a range of values or a collection of elements. It consists of three parts:

        Initialization: This is where you set the initial value of the loop variable.

        Condition: This is where you specify the condition for continuing the loop. The loop will continue as long as this condition is true.

        Increment: This is where you specify how the loop variable should be incremented or decremented with each iteration.
        */

        // Here's an example of a for loop that iterates over the numbers 1 to 5 and logs them to the console:
        for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            console.log(i);
        }

        // In this example, the loop variable i is initialized to 1, and the loop will continue as long as i is less than or equal to 5. The increment is specified as i++, which means that i will be incremented by 1 with each iteration.


        // You can also use a for loop to iterate over an array or other collection of elements. Here's an example that iterates over an array of colors and logs each color to the console:
        const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];

        for (let i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
            console.log(colors[i]);
        }

        // In this example, the loop variable i is initialized to 0, and the loop will continue as long as i is less than the length of the colors array. The increment is specified as i++, which means that i will be incremented by 1 with each iteration. Inside the loop, we use the loop variable i to access each element of the array by index, and log it to the console.
