            Variable naming is an essential aspect of programming in JavaScript. It refers to the practice of giving meaningful names to variables in order to make the code more readable, understandable, and maintainable. In JavaScript, variables can be named using letters, numbers, and underscores, but they must follow certain rules:

                Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign.
                Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs.
                Variable names are case-sensitive.
                Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.

            Here are some examples of good variable names:
        */

        let firstName = "John";
        let age = 30;
        let hasCar = true;
        let fullName = firstName + " Smith";


        // And here are some examples of poor variable names:
        let a = "John"; // Not descriptive
        let $ = 30; // Not meaningful
        let First_Name = "John"; // Not in camelCase format


        // By following good variable naming conventions, you can make your code more readable and easier to understand, not just for yourself, but also for other programmers who may read or work on your code.
