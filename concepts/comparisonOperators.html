    <h2>Check the console.</h2>

        /*
            JavaScript provides a set of comparison operators that allow you to compare values and return a boolean result (either true or false). Here are the comparison operators in JavaScript:

                == (loose equality): Returns true if the operands are equal, but doesn't require them to be of the same type.

                === (strict equality): Returns true if the operands are equal, and requires them to be of the same type.

                != (loose inequality): Returns true if the operands are not equal, but doesn't require them to be of the same type.

                !== (strict inequality): Returns true if the operands are not equal, and requires them to be of the same type.

                < (less than): Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.

                > (greater than): Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

                <= (less than or equal to): Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

                >= (greater than or equal to): Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
        */

        // Here's an example of how you could use the === operator to compare two values of the same type:
        let x = 10;
        let y = 10;

        if (x === y) {
            console.log("x and y are equal");
        } else {
            console.log("x and y are not equal");
        }

        // In this example, the output would be "x and y are equal" since x and y are both integers with the same value.


        // Example Code
        let age = 25;

        if (age >= 18 && age <= 30) {
            console.log("You're a young adult");
        } else if (age > 30) {
            console.log("You're not a young adult anymore");
        } else {
            console.log("You're not yet a young adult");
        }

        /*
            In this example, we have a variable age that is set to 25. We use the greater than or equal to (>=) and less than or equal to (<=) operators to check if age falls within the range of young adulthood (between 18 and 30 years old). If age is within that range, we print "You're a young adult" to the console.

            If age is greater than 30, we print "You're not a young adult anymore". Otherwise, if age is less than 18, we print "You're not yet a young adult". Note that we use the logical AND (&&) operator to check that age is both greater than or equal to 18 AND less than or equal to 30.
