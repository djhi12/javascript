            The repeat() method is a built-in function in JavaScript that is used to create a new string by repeating a given string a specified number of times.

             // The syntax of the repeat() method is as follows:
        s   tring.repeat(count);
        */

        // Here, string is the string that you want to repeat, and count is the number of times you want to repeat the string.


        // For example, if you want to create a string that repeats the word "hello" three times, you can use the repeat() method as follows:
        const repeatedString = "hello".repeat(3);
        console.log(repeatedString); // Output: "hellohellohello"

        // It's important to note that the repeat() method returns an empty string if the count parameter is 0, and it throws a RangeError if the count parameter is negative or if it's larger than or equal to Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER.


        // Example Program
        // Ask the user for a number of asterisks to generate
        const numAsterisks = prompt("How many asterisks do you want to generate?");

        // Generate a string of asterisks using the repeat() method
        const asterisksString = "*".repeat(numAsterisks);

        // Print the string of asterisks to the console
        console.log(asterisksString);

        // When you run this program, it will prompt the user to enter a number of asterisks to generate. Once the user enters a number, the program uses the repeat() method to generate a string of that many asterisks, and then prints the string to the console.


        // For example, if the user enters the number 5, the program will output the following string of asterisks: *****
