            JavaScript operators are used to perform operations on values or variables. Here are some of the most commonly used operators in JavaScript:

            Arithmetic operators: used to perform mathematical operations on numbers. These include:
                Addition (+): adds two values together
                Subtraction (-): subtracts one value from another
                Multiplication (*): multiplies two values together
                Division (/): divides one value by another
                Modulus (%): returns the remainder of a division operation
                Increment (++): adds 1 to a variable
                Decrement (--): subtracts 1 from a variable
            
            Comparison operators: used to compare values. These include:
                Equal to (==): compares two values for equality
                Not equal to (!=): compares two values for inequality
                Strict equal to (===): compares two values for equality and type
                Strict not equal to (!==): compares two values for inequality and type
                Greater than (>): checks if one value is greater than another
                Less than (<): checks if one value is less than another
                Greater than or equal to (>=): checks if one value is greater than or equal to another
                Less than or equal to (<=): checks if one value is less than or equal to another

            Logical operators: used to combine or invert Boolean values. These include:
                And (&&): returns true if both values are true
                Or (||): returns true if at least one value is true
                Not (!): inverts the value of a Boolean expression

            Assignment operators: used to assign values to variables. These include:
                Equal to (=): assigns a value to a variable
                Addition assignment (+=): adds a value to a variable and assigns the result to the variable
                Subtraction assignment (-=): subtracts a value from a variable and assigns the result to the variable
                Multiplication assignment (*=): multiplies a variable by a value and assigns the result to the variable
                Division assignment (/=): divides a variable by a value and assigns the result to the variable
                Modulus assignment (%=): calculates the remainder of dividing a variable by a value and assigns the result to the variable

            Other operators:
                Conditional (ternary) operator (?): used for conditional expressions, it returns one value if a condition is true and another value if the condition is false.
                typeof operator: returns the type of a value or variable.
                instanceof operator: returns true if an object is an instance of a specified constructor.
