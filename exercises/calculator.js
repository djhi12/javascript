/*
Problem Statement:

You are tasked with creating a simple calculator program in JavaScript. Your program should perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers and print the results to the console.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

Define two variables, num1 and num2, and assign them integer values of your choice.

Perform the following arithmetic operations:
1. Addition: Add num1 and num2, and store the result in a variable named sum.
2. Subtraction: Subtract num2 from num1, and store the result in a variable named difference.
3. Multiplication: Multiply num1 by num2, and store the result in a variable named product.
4. Division: Divide num1 by num2, and store the result in a variable named quotient.

Print each result along with a descriptive label to the console. For example:
"Sum: 15"
"Difference: 5"
"Product: 50"
"Quotient: 2"

Your task is to write JavaScript code that accomplishes the above steps. Ensure that your code is properly formatted and functional. Test your code by running it and verifying that it produces the expected output.

Once you have completed the task, submit your JavaScript code.

// Define variables for the numbers
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 5;

// Perform arithmetic operations
let sum = num1 + num2;
let difference = num1 - num2;
let product = num1 * num2;
let quotient = num1 / num2;

// Print results to the console
console.log("Sum:", sum);
console.log("Difference:", difference);
console.log("Product:", product);
console.log("Quotient:", quotient);
