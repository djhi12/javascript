<!--
    JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language. It is one of the most popular programming languages used for developing web applications, particularly on the client-side. JavaScript code is usually embedded directly in HTML pages and executed by web browsers, although it can also be executed outside of a browser environment, such as on servers or in desktop applications.

    JavaScript was first developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995 as a scripting language for web browsers. Since then, it has grown in popularity and evolved to include a wide range of features, including object-oriented programming, functional programming, and asynchronous programming.

    JavaScript is often used for creating interactive web user interfaces, dynamic web content, and browser-based games. It is also widely used for server-side programming, particularly with the Node.js runtime environment, which allows developers to use JavaScript on the server side as well.

    Some popular libraries and frameworks for JavaScript include jQuery, React, Angular, Vue.js, and Node.js, among others.
