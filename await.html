        /*
            In JavaScript, the "await" keyword is used in asynchronous functions to wait for a Promise to resolve before continuing the execution of the code.

            When an asynchronous function is called with the "await" keyword before a Promise, the function will pause its execution until the Promise is resolved. Once the Promise is resolved, the value it resolves with will be returned, and the function will continue its execution with that value.    
        */

        // Here's an example:
        async function fetchData() {
            const response = await fetch('https://example.com/data');
            const data = await response.json();
            return data;
        }

        fetchData().then(data => console.log(data));

        /*
            In the example above, the "fetchData" function uses the "await" keyword to wait for the response from the "fetch" function, and then again for the data to be parsed with the "json" method. Once the data is retrieved, it is returned from the function and logged to the console with a ".then" method.

            It's important to note that the use of the "await" keyword is only valid inside an asynchronous function, which is denoted by the "async" keyword before the function declaration.

        // Example Code
        async function fetchData() {
            try {
                const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
                const data = await response.json();
                console.log(data);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error(error);

        fetchData();

        /*
            In the example above, we're defining an asynchronous function called "fetchData" that uses the "await" keyword to wait for the response from the API before continuing execution.

            The "try-catch" block is used to handle any errors that may occur during the fetch operation. Inside the "try" block, we're making a call to the "fetch" method with the URL of the API endpoint as the argument. We then use the "await" keyword to wait for the response to come back.

            Once the response is received, we use the "await" keyword again to parse the response as JSON using the "json" method. Finally, we log the resulting data to the console.

            If there's an error during the fetch operation, it will be caught by the "catch" block and logged to the console. We call the "fetchData" function at the end to start the fetch operation.
